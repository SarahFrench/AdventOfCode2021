# Advent of Code 2021

[See Advent of Code 2021 here](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

2021 was my first time doing advent of code, and I did a few of the puzzles in the few days before Christmas when I was off work. It was nice playing around with Go code and having fun!

For the few days I did complete, I've split the code into parts 1 and 2 in the `parts` folder of each day's folder, and the `main.go` script for each day runs the code and generates the answers for that day's puzzle.

I did TDD using test cases I made info provided in the puzzles - this was key!
